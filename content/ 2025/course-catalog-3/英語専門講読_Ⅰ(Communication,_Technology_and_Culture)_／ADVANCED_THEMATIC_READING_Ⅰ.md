This course aims to study the roles of media technologies in modern society. We will survey the technological, social, political, and economic issues concerning the communication technologies, and examine how they influence our cultural forms. This course will introduce critical socio-cultural approach as a way of knowing the world and as a unique style of thinking. With the help of these socio-cultural concepts and strategies, students can reflectively and critically explore the old and new forms of communication in human history and their effects on our daily life. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to (1) identify and explain how technology is leading to the convergence of different types of media; (2) identify and explain how technology is changing the field of media (e.g. radio, TV and social media); (3) identify and explain both the positive and negative impacts that technology is having on individuals, culture and society.
