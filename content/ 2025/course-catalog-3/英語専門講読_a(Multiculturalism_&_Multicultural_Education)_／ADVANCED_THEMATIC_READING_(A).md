Societies around the world have been radically altered by colonialism, globalization, environmental destruction and civil unrest/war. Vast migrations of peoples have either voluntarily or involuntarily embarked on journeys for economic, personal or political reasons to countries and regions far from their homes. Indigenous peoples have suffered from colonialism and territorialism whereby foreign cultures where forced on native populations causing severe collective trauma, deculturalization and linguicide. In the Spring term this course considers the broader questions of multiculturalism with regard to the political, economic and social policies that multiethnic and multilingual countries face with shifting diversity and migratory populations changing the socio-cultural fabric of societies around the world. The fall term focuses on the institution of education as a site where production and reproduction of sociocultural values reinforces marginalization and disempowerment of minoritized groups. We then consider educational reforms and programs that address the social, economic and political inequities and inequalities that persist in countries around the globe.
