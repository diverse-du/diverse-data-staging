This thematic reading course will focus on intercultural communication- the knowledge and skills needed to communicate across cultures in our work, studies and social lives. The book "The Culture Map" provides a model or framework for understanding cultural differences across 8 parameters. In the Autumn semester we will cover the last 4 of these (chapters 5-8), while other readings from the field of intercultural communication will also be provided in order to examine the concepts in the Culture Map more critically. This course will give students a great opportunity for self-reflection: to reflect on their own cultural identity within their own country and in the world; their previous encounters with other cultures in their own life experience, and how they hope to integrate into a diverse and globalized society in the future.
