This thematic reading course will focus on intercultural communication- the knowledge and skills needed to communicate across cultures in our work, studies and social lives. The book "The Culture Map" provides a model or framework for understanding cultural differences across 8 parameters. In the Spring semester we will cover the first 4 of these, while other readings from the field of intercultural communication will also be provided in order to examine the concepts in the Culture Map broadly and critically. This course will give students a great opportunity for self-reflection: to reflect on their own cultural identity within their own country and in the world; their previous encounters with other cultures in their own life experience, and how they hope to integrate into a diverse and globalized society in the future.
