In public spaces, some problems of social inclusiveness are observed. In this course, entitled "Project Practice in Inclusive Spaces: Towards Social Well-being", you will collaboratively reassess the relationship between space and inclusiveness, in exploring and deepening your understanding through discussions and research. You will gain practical problem-solving experience in project management, focusing on specific issues based on personal interests and career plans. This year will focus on public spaces in Soka City, identifying challenges such as under-developed greenery and urban furniture, mobility barriers for disable or elder persons, recreation for citizens, resilience to delinquency and disasters. Collaborative projects will be undertaken by small teams throughout the semester. The semester's structure is as follows: (Part I) you will identify a specific theme based on your interests, analyzing it from various perspectives and exploring domestic and overseas examples to guide their project; (Part II) then, you will develop projects addressing the identified issues. Finally, you will present your study orally and submit a concise report summarizing the outcomes (one collective report for each team). ※Class conducted in both English and Japanese if international students in the course. シラバスは外国人留学生のために英語で書かれています（いなければ授業は日本語の予定）。語学の授業ではないことにご留意ください。 ※本科目は、外国部学部の学位授与方針（DP）に掲げる、演習において身に付ける能力、つまり「少人数での協働学習によるコミュニケーション・スキルやチームワーク能力」や「学習成果を自分の言葉で的確に表現することができる論理的なプレゼンテーション能力」を涵養することを目的とする。卒業後キャリアパスとして、商品開発や文化発信、ならびに観光・交通・不動産に関わる職種を想定しており、その他の職種でも実務上の能力の伸長に資するように設計されている。
