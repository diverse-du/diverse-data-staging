This thematic reading course aims to read various texts and critically examine the region of the American South, considering its historical, geographical, social, and cultural aspects. The American South is a region unfamiliar to those from outside of the region. However, it is a region that cannot be ignored when thinking about the social and political trajectory of the country. The topics we will cover in this class include immigration, politics, identities, food, religion, music, and arts. Through reading and discussions, students will be able to define and redefine the U.S. history from the South as we explore the diversities that the region embraces.
