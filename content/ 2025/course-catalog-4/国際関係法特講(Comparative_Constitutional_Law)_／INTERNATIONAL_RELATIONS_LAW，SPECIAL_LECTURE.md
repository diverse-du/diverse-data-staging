Comparative Constitutional law (CCL) studies can be defined as the research of differences and similarities between constitutional systems either across different nations or even across different periods of time. The purpose of CCL might be described as multifold. First and foremost, CCL may serve law students as a mechanism to better understand their own constitutional system. Also, by comparing the constitution of different nations students may be able to grasp current legal trends in the international arena and be better prepared to assess the possibilities of their implementation in their own country. The main objective of this introductory course is to provide students with basic notions on terminology and methods of CCL so they will be able to apply them to their own legal background.
