English has become the global language for communication, industry, and education, There are approximately 2 billion speakers of English in the world today and non-native speakers of English outnumber mother tongue speakers almost four to one. Although English is the fastest growing language in the world, its growth does not come from mother tongue speakers, such as is the case with other majority languages. The growth of English comes from the number of individuals who are learning English as an additional language, a language beyond or in addition to home and community language(s). English is sometimes described as a killer language, overpowering minority languages, but it has also been adopted and adapted to accommodate the needs and goals of local communities, resulting in varieties that have their own form, function and status, distinct from the “standard” English of Great Britain or the US. These varieties are called, World Englishes. This course introduces students to some of the fundamental issues and debates in the study of World Englishes through a historical and sociological lens. The spring course begins with a historical overview of the development of English from the Anglo-Saxon period to its current status and its spread around the world through colonization and globalization driven by the English Empire and American global domination.
