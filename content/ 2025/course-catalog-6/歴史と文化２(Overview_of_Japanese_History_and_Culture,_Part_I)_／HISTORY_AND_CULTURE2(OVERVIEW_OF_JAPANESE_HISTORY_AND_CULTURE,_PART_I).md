This class is an introductory course to Japanese history and culture, focusing on the beginning of Japan all the way through to the Meiji Restoration of 1868: prehistoric and ancient Japan (to 538), classical Japan (538-1185), medieval Japan (1185-1600), and the Edo period (1660-1868). Students will be asked to read various scholarly and general writings, watch related documentaries, listen to short lectures, and discuss them in class. The course will be conducted largely in English, so no advanced knowledge of Japanese is necessary. Students will make an independent trip to the Edo Tokyo Museum near Ryogoku Station, instead of attending class one week, and write a report on their impressions of their visit. One or two shorter essays will also be assigned, along with a final paper.
