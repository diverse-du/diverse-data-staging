The aim of the course during the second semester will be to give students the skill set to translate more effectively, focusing on translations from Japanese to English. Particular attention will be given to vocabulary nuance and word order. The materials used will include English translations of novels and essays by famous Japanese authors (including Matsuo Basho, Natsume Soseki, Yasunari Kawabata, Yukio Mishima, Shusaku Endo, Kobo Abe, Haruki Murakami, Banana Yoshimoto, Mitsuyo Kakuta), along with movies based on those authors’ works, and Japanese animated features (looking at the English and Japanese subtitles).The format of the course will consist of lectures in Japanese presenting excerpts from the material chosen for the week, with students doing short translations in class.
