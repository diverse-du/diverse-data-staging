This class is an introductory course to Japanese history and culture, focusing on the years following the 1868 Meiji Restoration: Meiji period (1868-1912), Taisho period (1912-26), Showa period (1912-89), Heisei period (1989-2019), and the Reiwa period (2020 onward). Students will be asked to read various scholarly and general writings, watch related documentaries, listen to lectures, and discuss them in class. The course will be conducted largely in English, so no advanced knowledge of Japanese is necessary. Students will make an independent trip to the Yasukuni Shrine and Yushukan Museum near Kudanshita and Ichigaya Stations, instead of attending class one week. They will also write a report on their impressions of their visit. One or two other essays will be assigned, along with a final report.
