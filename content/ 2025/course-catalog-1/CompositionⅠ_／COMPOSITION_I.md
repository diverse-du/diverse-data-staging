This course will enable students to master the basic paragraph structuring and writing skills in English. The basics of English Sentence construction will be studied and practiced leading to Paragraph Writing on various subjects. Areas covered will include brainstorming, organising, drafting, reviewing and revising. In addition to regular homework assignments, students will be expected to produce a number of printed Reports on subjects of their own choosing. It is necessary to have access to a computer and a printer as hand written assignments will not be accepted. In addition to regular attendance, students should bring a dictionary to class each week, an electronic one is preferable. I aim to make this an enjoyable Writing course!
