This course is required for all incoming first year students. It shares a common syllabus. The course introduces students to the dynamics of discussion and interaction within the English language classroom. Class size is limited to a maximum of 12 students. Students, together with the instructor, are seated in a circle in order to create an environment that facilitates meaningful and authentic communication. The primary goals for this course are to help students develop language and discussion skills, advance confidence in communicative English, and learn how to create and maintain a small group discussion. Additional course goals include learning about topics brought forth by students each week, and gaining a better perspective on one’s own English acquisition--for self-motivation.
