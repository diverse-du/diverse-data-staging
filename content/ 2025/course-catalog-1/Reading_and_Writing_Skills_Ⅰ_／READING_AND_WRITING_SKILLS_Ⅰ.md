With writing, the aim is for students at all levels to learn the fundamentals of English essay writing by practicing problem-solution essays. Overall Objectives – Reading 1. To understand how selected texts are structured. 2. To make connections between the text to self, text to text, and text to world. Overall Objectives – Writing 1. To understand and practice structuring problem-solution essays in English with an introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion, and learn essential essay components such a thesis statement, and topic sentences. 2.
