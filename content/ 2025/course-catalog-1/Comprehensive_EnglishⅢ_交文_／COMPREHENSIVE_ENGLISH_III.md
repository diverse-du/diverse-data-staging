This course is a required course for all 2nd year students. This course aims to help students further develop their English language fluency and builds on the skills acquired in the Round Table Discussion class for first-year students. It also focuses on enhancing students' presentation skills through weekly warm-up activities and more formal class presentations. A theme-based course text, emphasizing reading and critical thinking, serves as the foundation for the course and provides the basis for student presentations. Class size is limited to 12 students, and both students and the instructor will sit in a circle to foster meaningful and authentic communication. This class is fully conducted in English.
