PLEASE NOTE: This class is OPEN to ALL students in the Department of Tourism and Transnational Studies. This course introduces students to the dynamics of debate and will help you develop more fluency in English. Students can expect to learn how to formulate opinions on issues related to values and opinions, express their ideas within the format of a debate and refute the argumentation of others. Through various task students will learn how to develop critical thinking skills. In-class reading & writing activities will help students develop skills necessary for researching & organizing a successful debate. Students will also have the opportunity to observe various kinds of debate associated with the West. Upon completion of this course, students should be able to debate issues that are familiar to them. It will also introduce the idea of Persuasion and how it applies to debate and indeed ordinary life. The course focuses on improving students' "speaking" and “listening" skills and their "competence to think critically in English as well as hold discussions in English, without using Japanese," to obtain comprehensive English proficiency and to engage in logical discussions using English. Classroom time will be utilized by having students present their ideas from assigned readings, and will collectively establish formal debate topics for our classroom debates. Please feel free to contact the instructor if you have any questions. njost@dokkyo.ac.jp
