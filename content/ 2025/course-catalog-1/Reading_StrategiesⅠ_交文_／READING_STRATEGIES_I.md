This course aims to develop students' reading comprehension skills through engaging cultural topics. By analyzing a variety of texts, students will expand their vocabulary and refine their understanding of grammar in context. Additionally, they will learn to recognize and apply logical patterns used in academic and persuasive writing. Through guided discussions, students will further enhance their ability to articulate ideas and engage critically with the themes explored in the readings, fostering both linguistic proficiency and cultural awareness.
