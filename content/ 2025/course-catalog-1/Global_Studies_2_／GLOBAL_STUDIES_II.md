This course is designed to help students to gain a fresh understanding of Japanese society by focusing on issues related to prejudice and discrimination in contemporary Japan. Drawing on the literature of intercultural/intergroup contact, this course provides students with opportunities to feel the world of persons who are subjected to prejudice as well as to analyse its psychological, sociological and educational dimensions. Students are also invited to the world of the ‘Human Library’, in which they will listen informally to people susceptible to prejudice in society (e.g. people with disabilities, sexual minorities, refugees, disaster victims) in order to gain different perspectives on prejudice and life in general. This course is highly recommended to students who want to (re)discover Japan from a co-cultural perspective and with global implications, and more importantly, to discover their unknown self through dialogue.
