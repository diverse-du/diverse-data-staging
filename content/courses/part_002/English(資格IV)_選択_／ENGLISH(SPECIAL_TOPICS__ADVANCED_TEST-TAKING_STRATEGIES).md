IELTS PREPARATION CLASS (The International English Language Testing System) Now more than ever, English language proficiency is a necessity in the global work environment. Students will be introduced to the format of the IELTS exam at the beginning of the course. There are four parts to IELTS. These are listening, reading, writing and speaking, and they are taken in this order. Listening and speaking, writing and reading comprehension skills in English take time to develop. The best way to improve is with lots of exposure and practice. Throughout the semester, topic-based units will be explored while focusing on the four skills. A variety of short assignments will also be introduced to help prepare students for sitting the exam. This course is designed to help students who plan to take the IELTS exam, but it is also suitable for students who wish to continue studying English and to improve their English skills in general. There are four parts to IELTS. These are listening, reading, writing and speaking. The course will aim to help students to improve their overall English language skills. Students should have achieved a TOEIC score of around 450 or more before enrolling in this class.
