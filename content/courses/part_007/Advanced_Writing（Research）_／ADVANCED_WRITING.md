The goals of the Advanced Academic Writing (Research) course are to refine the writing skills students should have developed in their previous writing courses in order to write academic essays by enhancing reading, critical thinking, and research skills. Students will be taught how to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize diverse sources and viewpoints to develop persuasive and academic essays. When writing academic essays, learning how to summarize, paraphrase, and draft revisions will be emphasized. APA style will be used. (one semester course) This course focuses on students’ "writing" skills, as stated in DP 2. It helps students obtain "comprehensive English proficiency" and to acquire "the ability to express various ideas and issues in correct English written form" stated in the CP.
