The aim of the course during the first semester will be to give students the skill set to translate more effectively, focusing on translations FROM ENGLISH TO JAPANESE. Particular attention will be given to common mistranslations and translation strategies. The materials used will mainly include magazine articles (mainly from Newsweek and Newsweek Japan), poems (by Robert Frost, et al.), fiction (Mark Twain’s “Huckleberry Finn,” etc.), along with English-language movies (Japanese subtitles and/or dubbing), and mention will also be given to translation and interpretation as occupations. The format of the course will consist of lectures in Japanese presenting excerpts from the material chosen for the week, with students expected to do short translations in class. Students will also be expected to compare and discuss their translations with each other in class.
