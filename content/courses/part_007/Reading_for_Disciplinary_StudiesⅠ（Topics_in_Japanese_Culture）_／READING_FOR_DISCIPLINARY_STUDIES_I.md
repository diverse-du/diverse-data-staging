The aim of this reading course is to examine different threads and ideas prevalent in Japanese culture. Threads originating in historical times that are still present, if even in a hybrid form, will be the main focus. Some such ideas may include harmony, respect, mindfulness, concepts of religion as well as others. Materials used will come from translations of original works as well as news articles, journals and academic writings. This is a required course as stated within the curriculum guidelines for graduation from the Department of Tourism and Transnational Studies.
