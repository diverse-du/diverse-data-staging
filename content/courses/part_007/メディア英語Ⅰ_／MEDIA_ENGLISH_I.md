English for Media Literacy is targeted at students whose English is at an intermediate level. You cannot take this course and my Media English II class at the same time. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the various types of English used in the media world, especially video clips and newspapers. The emphasis of the first part of the semester will be on travelogues, making reference to online articles, videos and other information. Students will do a pair presentation using PowerPoint describing a trip to a certain country. The second half of the course will teach students how to write newspaper articles and produce a newspaper, with actual physical newspapers to be made in groups composed of four to six students.
