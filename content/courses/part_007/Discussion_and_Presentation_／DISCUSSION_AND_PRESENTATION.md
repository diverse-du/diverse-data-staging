PLEASE NOTE: This class is OPEN to ALL students in the Department of Tourism and Transnational Studies. This course introduces students to the dynamics of discussion and will help you develop more fluency in English. This course sets out to help students develop communicative competence through active discussion, and to help students develop their understanding of current affairs. We will look at what constitutes a discussion, and develop the skills necessary to maintain an active discussion. Students will be called upon to do research and prepare discussion topics based on what they read in the news outside of class. They are also required to maintain a course journal. This course has a strict English only policy. Upon completion of this course, students will able to discuss various topics in English with higher level of confidence. The course focuses on improving students' "speaking" and “listening" skills and their "competence to think critically in English as well as hold discussions in English, without using Japanese," to obtain comprehensive English proficiency and to engage in logical discussions using English. Students will be able to develop a connection with other students by sharing thoughts and ideas through our weekly group discussion sessions. Please feel free to contact the instructor if you have any questions. njost@dokkyo.ac.jp
