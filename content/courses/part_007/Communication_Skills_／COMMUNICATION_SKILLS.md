The OBJECTIVES of this seminar/ course are to encourage students to: 0) decide on a concrete topic to research, & then discuss/ debate in English. 1) research & read MANY RELIABLE English sources about that topic (both ‘Pro’ & ‘Con’). 2) make a ‘Pro’ or ‘Con’ presentation about one side of the issue, in English. 3) ACTIVELY listen to other students’ OPPOSING presentation(s) about that issue. 4) then DEBATE critically with the opposing ‘side’, in order to hopefully figure out a REASONABLE, Logical ‘Middle Ground’.
