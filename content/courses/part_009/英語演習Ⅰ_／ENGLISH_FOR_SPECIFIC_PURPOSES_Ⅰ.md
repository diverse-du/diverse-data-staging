This course will explore the role of idioms in language use. Idioms are multi-word expressions (e.g., "be at a crossroads," "the tip of the iceberg," "safe and sound") that are learned and used as "chunks" rather than as individual words. This means they are part of formulaic language, which is important for learners to acquire in order to become proficient users of English. In this course, we will focus on key aspects of English idioms, including the definition of "idiom," the limits of fixedness and variability, and the exploitation of idioms in journalism and advertising. We will also discuss how idiom usage in daily life reflects general principles of language use. The main aims of this course are for students to: 1) gain an understanding of what past research says about key aspects of idioms; 2) build their vocabulary (both receptive and productive); 3) develop their ability to participate actively in group discussions and do oral presentations about specialized topics, using English.
