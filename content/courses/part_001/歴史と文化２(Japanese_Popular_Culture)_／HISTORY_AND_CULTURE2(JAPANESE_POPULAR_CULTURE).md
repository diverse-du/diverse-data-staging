Monsters in Japanese Popular Culture: From oral traditions and folklore to modern mass-market media, monsters are as much about how we define ourselves as they are about how we circumscribe and contain the other. They can take many forms: horrific or beautiful, tangible or immaterial, gentle or violent. They can represent our fantasies and desires as much as our fears and anxieties. In this course we will study a range of examples from anime and manga, movies and literature, even popular music and fashion. Students will analyze monsters in Japanese popular culture with a focus on the sociocultural and historic contexts that have given rise and popularity to specific forms and functions. Major assignments will include a short critical essay and a final presentation.「講義はすべて英語で行います。TOEIC 700、TOEFL(IBT) 71、英検準一級程度以上の英語力を必要とします。」
