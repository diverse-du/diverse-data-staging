This is a designated course offered to freshmen in the Faculties of Law and Economics, and to majors of German and French. This course is offered in parallel with Academic Reading Strategies I (ARS I). This course is designed to build students’ abilities to understand natural spoken English in academic contexts. Students will listen to passages such as academic lectures, formal presentations, meetings, and conversations between students. Skills such as note-taking, making inferences, and discussion will be practiced in class. The course also aims to develop learners’ critical thinking skills and overall academic literacy. 基礎的なリスニング力を大学での勉強や仕事に活かせる実践的なレベルに発展させます。日常会話、インタビュー、レクチャーなどを聞いて内容を確認するほか、TOEIC L&R TestⓇの聴解問題にも取り組み、頻出表現の学習を行います。
