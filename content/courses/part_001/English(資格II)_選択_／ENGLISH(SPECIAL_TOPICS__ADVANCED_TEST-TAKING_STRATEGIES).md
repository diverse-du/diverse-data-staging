In rapidly globalizing society, English competence is no longer just a nice skill to have – it is a necessary skill for success in various fields. The purpose of this course is to provide students with good communication skills in English and, as a consequence, help them get a high score on the TOEIC L/R Test. For this purpose, a TOEIC Listening/Reading workbook will be used as a main textbook, focusing on both listening and reading exercises. The course activities also include intensive and extensive vocabulary-building exercises and quick reviews on grammar they learned in high school to totally strengthen their command of English. Students are expected to work hard both in class and at home so that all of them can score more than 730 points on the TOEIC L/R when they finish the course.
