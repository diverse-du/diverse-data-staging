This course is a subject of "Microeconomics" in order to acquire "expertise in economics" indicated by DP and CP of the Faculty of Economics. This class provides an introduction to basic economic concepts, and is taught in English. The class is divided into two parts: first, we will cover basic macroeconomic concepts such as GDP, unemployment, economic growth.
