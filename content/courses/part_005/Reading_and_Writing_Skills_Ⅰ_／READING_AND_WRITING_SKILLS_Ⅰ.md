This one-semester course is compulsory for first-year students and takes place twice a week. The course is not meant to privilege either skill over the other but is envisioned to develop reading comprehension skills while guiding students to produce well-structured problem-solution essays on topics they can explore in readings. The aim is to develop active reading skills through exploration of text and discussions related to it. With writing, the aim is for students at all levels to learn the fundamentals of English essay writing by practicing problem-solution essays. Overall Objectives – Reading 1. To understand how selected texts are structured. 2. To make connections between the text to self, text to text, and text to world. Overall Objectives – Writing 1. To understand and practice structuring problem-solution essays in English with an introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion, and learn essential essay components such a thesis statement, and topic sentences. 2. To learn to develop ideas logically and effectively in paragraphs. This course focuses on developing students’ combined reading and writing skills, specifically: "vocabulary," "grammar" and "reading" skills, as stated in DP 2 for them to acquire the basics of both "written receptive skills," (reading) and "written productive skills," (writing) as stated in the CP.
