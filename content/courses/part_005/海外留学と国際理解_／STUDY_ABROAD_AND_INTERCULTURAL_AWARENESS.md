Grounded in recent scholarship in psychological, educational and intercultural studies, this course is aimed at helping students to gain a global perspective of study abroad and develop further their intercultural competence and confidence as a learner of the English language. This aim is consistent with the curriculum policy set by English Department that stresses the development of social responsibility as a global/international citizen into students. Topics to be covered include but are not limited to: globalisation and international student mobility; personal and professional impact of study abroad; culture shock; study shock; racism and discrimination; personal growth and transformation; global jinzai (human resources); and online education.
