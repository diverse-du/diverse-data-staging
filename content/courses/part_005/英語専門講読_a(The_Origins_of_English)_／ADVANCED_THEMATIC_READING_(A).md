This course is designed to help students interested in language and language learning to better understand the English language. In this course we will look at the history of the English language, from its obscure Sanskrit origins to the role in Europe in the Middle Ages. By reading and discussing the text material, including pre-reading and post-reading activities to enhance the reader’s comprehension, it is hoped that students will come away from this course with a better understanding of the English language today.
