Japanese Painting and Prints This course will focus on the history and culture of Japanese painting and prints. To accommodate each lecture, and to aid students in gaining an understanding of the principal genres and styles of Japanese painting and prints, numerous slides will be shown featuring examples of representative works. Supplemental readings and associated exercises will be provided to ensure comprehension of specialized terms and to facilitate an understanding of the historical and cultural context. By the completion of the course, students will be able to identify and distinguish the principal genres and styles of Japanese painting and prints and explain the characteristics of each in an articulate and informed manner. The aims of this course are consistent with the curriculum policy (CP) and diploma policy (DP) set by the Department of English, to provide a deep understanding and specialized knowledge in the academic field of Japanese art, culture, literature, and history through English-taught lectures.
