This is a one-semester-long required course for 1st-year students (I: spring semester, II: fall semester). Overall Objectives: In this course, students are expected to develop their overall English language skills while learning about specific topics. The course is called “workshop” because it is a combination of lectures by instructors and activities in which students are actively engaged in interaction with classmates and the material. Topics: The topic of each unit is decided by the individual instructor. Topic examples include “Art of the Renaissance,” “English through Music,” “Work and Play,” “The Science of Habits,” “Money Matters,” “Art Stories,” and “Japanese Myths and Legends.” The course focuses on cultivating students' "listening," "speaking," "vocabulary" and "writing" skills, as stated in DP 2. It also helps students acquire the basics of "oral receptive and productive skills" and "written receptive and productive skills," as stated in the CP.
