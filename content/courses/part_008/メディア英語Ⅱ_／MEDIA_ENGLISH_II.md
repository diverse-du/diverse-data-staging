Media English II is designed for students whose English is at an advanced level. It is more difficult than my English for Media Literacy course, and you cannot take both courses at the same time. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the various types of English used in the media world, especially newspapers, magazines, and documentaries. The emphasis will be on political, social, and economic/business stories, with a focus on Japan. Possible documentaries to be shown include “Hiroshima” (BBC). As timely articles will be chosen, it is impossible to identify them beforehand. The format of the course will be for students to read/view prepared materials every week, to participate actively in discussions, and to submit written essays when requested. A final project will also be assigned, probably about the future of media.
