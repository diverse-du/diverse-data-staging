This course includes the same plan as the spring semester. If you retake this course it is likely to involve new dynamics as the groups and choices involved may create different situations in the fictional advertising company scenario. However, expect a review of activities. The aim of this course is to provide opportunities to practice business writing skills to help students in their future workplace. By the end of the course, you will have experienced simulations of real-world business tasks that will provide a window into an international business environment.
