This course builds upon the skills developed in the first semester, further strengthening students' reading comprehension through engaging cultural topics. By analyzing a diverse range of texts, students will continue expanding their vocabulary and deepening their understanding of grammar in context. Additionally, they will refine their ability to recognize and apply logical patterns in academic and persuasive writing. Through guided discussions, students will enhance their ability to articulate complex ideas and engage in more nuanced critical analysis of the themes explored, fostering greater linguistic proficiency and cultural awareness.
