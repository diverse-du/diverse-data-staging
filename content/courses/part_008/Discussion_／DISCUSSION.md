You will read and discuss interesting topics and issues some of which lend themselves to making opinions. Some of the topics cover cultural aspects and social issues in North America while others are universal. There will also be the opportunity for students to lead discussions and decide on topics they are free to choose. It is expected that the students will do the necessary research on their discussion topic to state their opinion well. For researching their discussion topics, students are free to use the Internet, newspapers, magazines, academic journals, and books. It is hoped that these activities will enhance the students academic research skills. The course focuses on improving students' "speaking" and “listening" skills and their "competence to think critically in English as well as hold discussions in English, without using Japanese," as stated in DP 2. Overall objectives are for students "to obtain comprehensive English proficiency" and "to engage in logical discussions using English," as stated in the CP.
