This course is designed for you. The main theme is “creative writing”. However, the class is set up to provide a good deal of freedom for the students to work in any form they wish. The students can write in academic style if they would like more practice doing so. Also, they can explore various creative styles including poetry, screenplay, and narrative writing. If you want to practice writing with AI programs (like ChatGPT) we can work with skills that can be useful for your future career. You can even write songs if you like. All the writing is shared and discussed in workshops with input from the peers in the class as well as analysis from the teacher. The focus of the class is to develop writing forms and expression of ideas in natural English.
