To study a variety of topics in English, allowing students to not only improve their English language skills but also give them new ideas and information. This course develops English academic skills, which will also be of use to students in their future careers. The course aims to: 1 Develop vocabulary learning strategies, reading and listening skills through working with audiovisual and written material. 2 Practice and develop writing and speaking skills through individual, pair work and group work activities. Understand the structure of academic essays (sentences, paragraphs and essays) and produce two essays through a process of planning, writing a first draft, receiving feedback from the instructor and peers, which is then used to produce a final well-structured and well-formatted essay in English.
