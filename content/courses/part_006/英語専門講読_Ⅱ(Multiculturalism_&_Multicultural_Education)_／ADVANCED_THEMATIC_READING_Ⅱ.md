Multicultural education is not just about exploring various cultures in the classroom. It is also about addressing individual biases, inequities, stereotypes, systemic discrimination and the ways they influence both how teachers teach and students learn and engage in, or resist, the education they are receiving as well as the school culture. In this course we will examine the ways that various teaching practices and socio-cultural perspectives impact the learning environment. By building awareness of a variety of perspectives, students will better understand how schools both reflect, produce and reproduce social inequities that exist outside of the classroom and school and consider the ways in which a shift toward a social justice-oriented education can begin to address and correct these long-standing inequities.
