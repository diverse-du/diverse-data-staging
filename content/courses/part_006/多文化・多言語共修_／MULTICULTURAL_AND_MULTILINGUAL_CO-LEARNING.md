This one semester course aims to provide a forum for exchange students and students from the English department to discuss and learn about a variety of social issues from multicultural perspectives. While the language of instruction is English, students are also encouraged to use their first languages to overcome difficulties with the course materials and in their group discussions. Students will be presented with articles on a variety of social issues affecting contemporary Japanese society. These issues will be discussed in the Japanese context, and students will be challenged to reflect and consider how these issues affect and are dealt with in other cultures.
