This course focuses on improving students’ vocabulary & grammar knowledge and listening & reading skills, as stated in DP 2. This helps students acquire the basics of "written receptive skills," as stated in the CP. This is one-semester-long course required for first-year students. Overall Objectives are; 1. For students to build their vocabulary 2. For students to relearn grammatical rules 3. For students to improve their reading and listening skills In the other English skill courses (that are LW, R&W, CS), students meet in classes at scheduled times and learn English language skills from their instructors. To improve their practical skills, they need more “training” in vocabulary, grammar, and basic receptive skills, i.e. reading and listening. In this course, they work on various web-based exercises made toward this end, and they do so at their own pace and convenience.
