The focus topics and themes will for the most part be presented chronologically, beginning with 7th century Gigaku masks and concluding with 19th century decorative masks produced for export. Please see the Course Schedule (授業計画詳細情報) for a full list of topics. To accommodate each lecture, and to aid students in gaining an understanding of the various categories and types of masks, numerous slides will be shown featuring examples of representative works.

The aims of this course are consistent with the curriculum policy (CP) and diploma policy (DP) set by the Department of English, to provide a deep understanding and specialized knowledge in the academic field of Japanese art, culture, literature, and history through English-taught lectures.
