The objective of this course is to show why the English known as a global language and how people from different background are expressing their culture in English. Language is indissolubly linked with the members of the society in which it is spoken, and social factors are inevitably reflected in their speech. Language can be studied as a social phenomenon. English is currently regarded as the world’s principal international language. It performs a useful function in the multilingual society. People are not forced to master English at all costs. There are people who adopt English and use it alongside their own culture, and combine it with. In this class we will look at how English varies around the world as well as at issues that affect language usage such as age, gender, and class.
